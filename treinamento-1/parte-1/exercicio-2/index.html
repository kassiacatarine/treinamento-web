        <p>"The everything store" was never the extent of Amazon's ambition. 
            Jeff Bezos has built a business that is, ultimately, about offering every kind of access to every kind of thing. 
            You can buy shoes and coyote urine, subscribe to periodicals and deodorant, stream music and movies and TV shows. 
            Oddly, books have been the holdout, as Amazon's fights with publishers have largely kept it from experimenting with new forms of packaging and distribution.

        <p>That's what's so exciting about 
            <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/7/16/5907531/amazon-working-on-kindle-unlimited-subscription-service">Kindle Unlimited</a>, the $9.99 / month subscription reading service Amazon appears to be

            It's the "Netflix for books" idea that a number of companies have tried, all to middling success: pay one price, read as many books as you like. 
            Amazon's leaked documentation promises more than 600,000 books and "thousands" of audiobooks to Kindle Unlimited subscribers, and there's no question Amazon's potential selection far outweighs its competitors'. 
            Not to mention, Amazon has the clout to make deals with publishers that other companies may never even get in the room for.

            Netflix is so successful that it seems any "Netflix for X" would be popular. 
            But there’s some evidence that it won’t work in every market. 
            In 2013, the average person spent <a href="https://www.bls.gov/news.release/atus.t11.htm">2.8 hours</a>
             watching TV every day, nearly half of their so-called "leisure time." (Some age groups spent more than four hours.) 
            All Netflix had to do was take some of that time away from cable, and without changing anyone’s habits it became immensely successful.
